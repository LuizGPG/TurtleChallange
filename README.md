# TurtleChallange
## Description
This challange was so nice to implement because everytime that I looked I thought "hmmm if the user do somehting likes this... or if I use this class to join some equal lines..."

So I was based in this file to create this project: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lgc-public/TurtleChallenge.pdf


To run the project you just need clone it and run in VisualStudio.
The files that i used to test ar in the project, that are <a href=https://github.com/LuizGPG/TurtleChallange/blob/master/MyPositions.txt>MyPositions</a> and 
<a href=https://github.com/LuizGPG/TurtleChallange/blob/master/Moves.txt>Moves</a>. But you can use yours because the project will ask for.
If you don't put a file in project we will use that ones that I said before.

I hope that was enough to join a big company like a LetsGetChecked and learn more to be better.

Thank you for your time.
